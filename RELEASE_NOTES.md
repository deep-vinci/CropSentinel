## Known Limitations

| Item | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Backend cold-start | Hosted on free Render tier — first request after inactivity takes 30–50 s. API timeout set to 50 s. |
| No offline cache | Real mode requires internet. Switching to Demo Mode provides offline functionality. |
| Farm coordinates | Currently entered manually as numeric lat/lon. Live GPS picker is a future enhancement. |
| Social login | Google / Apple buttons show an informational alert (not implemented). |
| Edit / Delete farm | Backend `PUT /farm/:id` and `DELETE /farm/:id` endpoints are stubbed; falls back to local mock state. |
