# CropSentinel Walkthrough - D1-D4 Finalization

This document provides a walkthrough of the features implemented during Days 1 to 4 of CropSentinel.

## 📱 Navigation & Screens (D1)

The mobile application implements a complete user journey with the following stack:

1. **OnboardingScreen**: Introduction to the platform with "Get Started" call-to-action.
2. **LoginScreen**: Authentication gateway for registered farmers.
3. **MyFarmsScreen**: Dashboard hub showing a summary of average field health, active AI agent status, current weather conditions, and lists of registered farms.
4. **FarmDetailScreen**: Deep-dive into a specific field featuring:
   * Dynamic health score indicator.
   * Four-metric grid (NDVI, Soil Moisture, Weather Risk, Mandi Market Risk).
   * Mini-map card simulating a satellite view with a diamond farm polygon.
   * Trend charts showing NDVI history and Mandi Price trends.
5. **AlertsFeedScreen**: Categorized notifications/alerts stream displaying actionable items.
6. **InterventionDetailScreen**: Detailed breakdown of an alert with recommended actions, cost estimates, risk metrics, and "Take Action" response buttons.
7. **SettingsScreen**: Toggle settings for notifications and navigation access to sub-settings like Help & Support or About.

## 🗺️ Satellite Map Visualization (D2)

* **Satellite View**: Displays high-resolution map representations of the farm zone.
* **Farm Polygon Rendering**: Uses a styled overlay representing the exact geographic boundary of the farm, color-coded based on severity level.

## ⚙️ Service Scaffolding & Integration (D3)

* **Service Layer**: Configured in `src/services/` with an API client (`src/services/api.js`) and a wrapper logic (`src/services/index.js`).
* **Environment Switch**: Uses `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` in `src/config/environment.js` to run in local mock mode, with automatic fallback to mock data when API calls fail.
* **Loading & Error Components**: Built unified `LoadingState` and `ErrorState` components in `src/components/` to handle asynchronous states gracefully across all screens.

## 📊 SVG Charts & Notifications (D4)

* **Pure SVG Charts**: Built clean, responsive sparklines using React Native SVG (`SvgSparkline` in `FarmDetailScreen.js`) to display NDVI trends and Mandi price trends. This has zero dependencies on heavy native modules, ensuring perfect compatibility with Expo Go.
* **Local Notifications**: Implemented Expo Go compatible local notification scheduling in `src/services/notifications.js`.
* **Push Toggle Settings**: Integrated notification settings switch in Settings screen allowing users to toggle notification handling and trigger permission request flows.
* **Expo SDK 56**: Validated configuration parameters in `package.json` and `app.json` for Expo SDK 56.

## 🚀 Demo Mode, Simulation & Polish (D5)

* **Demo Mode settings section**: Added a dedicated "Demo Mode" header and description card under Profile Settings, with a toggle to switch the global `isDemoMode` state.
* **Lightweight Global State Subscription**: Built a zero-dependency subscription store in `src/config/demoState.js` to manage the demo simulation variables (`isDemoMode`, `isDroughtSimulated`) and sync views dynamically.
* **Simulate Drought Flow**: Visible on `FarmDetailScreen` when Demo Mode is active. Tapping it triggers a visual transition from healthy/moderate sugarcane conditions (health: 78, NDVI: 0.65) to critical drought status (health: 41, NDVI: 0.22).
* **Animated Success & Confirmation Feedback**: Tapping "Apply Intervention" scales in a checkmark feedback animation modal saying "Intervention recorded successfully.", schedules a local notification, and updates demo state tracking.
* **npx expo-doctor** passed successfully with `21/21 checks passed. No issues detected!`.

## 🚜 Dedicated Farms Experience & Dashboard Redesign (D5 Final Polish)

To resolve the duplicate content between the "Home" and "Farms" tabs, a complete UX pass was completed before Day 6.

### 1. Dedicated Farms Screen (`FarmsScreen.js`)
* **Purpose**: Acts as the centralized farm management hub.
* **Layout**:
  * **Header**: "My Farms" title and subtext "Manage and monitor all your fields."
  * **Search Bar**: Material 3 styled input with dynamic search filtering by farm name.
  * **Filter Chips**: Horizontal scrollable chips ("All", "Healthy", "Warning", "Critical") with custom logic (Healthy >= 75, Warning 50-74, Critical < 50).
  * **Interaction Menu**: Three-dot vertical menu providing:
    * *View Details*: Navigates to the deep-dive metrics.
    * *Edit Farm*: Prefills `AddFieldScreen` fields for updates.
    * *Delete Farm*: Local state array removal with confirmation alert dialog.
  * **Extended FAB**: A bottom-right Floating Action Button styled with Material 3 patterns "+ Add Farm" to trigger field additions.

### 2. Overview Dashboard Redesign (`MyFarmsScreen.js`)
* **Purpose**: Converts the Home tab into a summary status dashboard.
* **Layout**:
  * **Critical Alerts Banner**: Displays counts of critical issues. Links directly to the alerts stream.
  * **Highest-Risk Farm Card**: Automatically calculates the field with the lowest health score and features it prominently.
  * **Latest AI Recommendation Card**: Displays action items, estimated cost, ROI, and AI confidence parameters.
  * **AI Agent Core Widget**: Standardizes check-ins for Satellite, Weather, and Soil AI sub-agents.
  * **No Duplication**: The list of all fields has been completely removed.

### 3. Navigation Upgrades
* Bottom navigation bars across `MyFarmsScreen`, `FarmsScreen`, `AlertsFeedScreen`, `InterventionDetailScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, and `FarmDetailScreen` have been fully linked to coordinate with the new screen hierarchy.
* All routes pass bundling validation via `npx expo export` and health checks via `npx expo-doctor`.

### 4. Global Language Localization, M3 Dialogs & Haptics (D5 Final Polish Pass)
* **Global Language Localization**: Audit and implementation completed across all 12 app screens. Switches dynamically and immediately between English and Hindi based on user settings without needing app restarts.
* **Premium Material 3 Dialogs**: Popups in `AddFieldScreen` (save farm success) and `InterventionDetailScreen` (recorded recommendations success dialog with cost/risk ROI metrics) styled to Material 3 standard (rounded 28dp corners, clean entry scale/fade timing animations).
* **Haptic Feedback**: Subtle physical responses added to selectors, settings toggle switches, buttons, and simulation actions, safely wrapped in `try/catch` to ensure complete compatibility on devices/emulators that do not support haptics.
* **Build Integrity**: Checked using `npx expo-doctor` (21/21 passed) and validated using `npx expo export` (both iOS and Android bundles successfully compiled and generated under `dist/` without any warnings).

## D5 Bug Fix Pass — Settings Localization & Unique Keys

Two regressions were successfully resolved on the Settings tab:

1. **Unique Key Prop Warning**:
   - **Root Cause**: The settings menu items rendering loop mapped items using `key={item.label}`. If translations were missing, `label` resolved to `undefined` or duplicate keys, causing React rendering warnings and leading to missing items.
   - **Solution**: Replaced key attribute with a stable, semantic key identifier (`item.id`) matching `account`, `notifications`, `help`, and `about`.
2. **Missing Settings Labels & Fallbacks**:
   - **Root Cause**: Translation tables lacked a nested settings dictionary. Localized labels (e.g. `accountSettings`) were missing entirely from `translations.js`.
   - **Solution**: Added the nested `settings: { ... }` object to both Hindi and English catalogs in [translations.js](file:///c:/Users/Yesh%20bind/OneDrive/Desktop/Faraway/src/constants/translations.js). Used safe fallback properties inside [SettingsScreen.js](file:///c:/Users/Yesh%20bind/OneDrive/Desktop/Faraway/src/screens/SettingsScreen.js) (e.g. `translations[language]?.settings?.account ?? translations.en.settings.account`) to guarantee label availability.
3. **Verification**:
   - Bundling (`npx expo export`) and diagnostics (`npx expo-doctor`) verified successfully, ensuring 100% Expo Go compatibility.

## 🔌 Day 6 — Backend API Integration

We have fully connected the mobile application to the FastAPI python backend deployed on Render, implementing authentication, farm CRUD, history tracking, orchestration pipeline triggering, and intervention/recommendation persistence.

### Key Integrations Completed:
1. **Dynamic JWT Phone Authentication**:
   - Refactored `LoginScreen.js` to send passwordless login requests to `/auth/login`.
   - The returned `access_token` is stored in the global `demoState` store and automatically injected as a `Bearer` authorization token for all subsequent requests.
2. **Farm List & History Parallel Fetching**:
   - Refactored `FarmsScreen.js` to fetch registered farms from `/farm/list`.
   - Resolves NDVI history and risk severity for each farm in parallel by hitting the `/history/{farm_id}` endpoint.
3. **Farm Creation and Fallback Editing/Deletion**:
   - Connects Save Field in `AddFieldScreen.js` to `/farm/create` for new fields.
   - For update (`PUT`) and delete (`DELETE`), since the backend does not expose native routes, handlers point to `/farm/{id}` endpoints, falling back to local/mock operations on 404/failure.
4. **Real-time Pipeline Analysis**:
   - Deep-dive screen `FarmDetailScreen.js` invokes `/analyze` orchestrator pipeline, fetching Sentinel-2 NDVI metrics and weather risk forecasts.
5. **AI Recommendation/Intervention Application**:
   - Added a new service handler `submitIntervention` in `api.js`, `mockApi.js`, and `index.js`.
   - Updated `InterventionDetailScreen.js` to post applied intervention details to the backend on request trigger, falling back to mock persistence.
6. **Diagnostics & Bundling Validation**:
   - Diagnostics successfully checked with `npx expo-doctor` (21/21 passed).
   - Bundling successfully validated with `npx expo export`.
