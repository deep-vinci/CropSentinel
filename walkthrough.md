# CropSentinel Walkthrough - D1-D4 Finalization

This document provides a walkthrough of the features implemented during Days 1 to 4 of CropSentinel.

## 📱 Navigation & Screens (D1)

The mobile application implements a complete user journey with the following stack:

1. **OnboardingScreen**: Introduction to the platform with "Get Started" call-to-action.
2. **LoginScreen**: Authentication gateway for registered farmers.
3. **MyFarmsScreen**: Dashboard hub showing a summary of average field health, active AI agent status, current weather conditions, and lists of registered farms.
4. **FarmDetailScreen**: Deep-dive into a specific field featuring:
   * Dynamic health score indicator.
   * Four-metric grid (NDVI, Soil Moisture, Weather Risk, Mandi Market Risk).
   * Mini-map card simulating a satellite view with a diamond farm polygon.
   * Trend charts showing NDVI history and Mandi Price trends.
5. **AlertsFeedScreen**: Categorized notifications/alerts stream displaying actionable items.
6. **InterventionDetailScreen**: Detailed breakdown of an alert with recommended actions, cost estimates, risk metrics, and "Take Action" response buttons.
7. **SettingsScreen**: Toggle settings for notifications and navigation access to sub-settings like Help & Support or About.

## 🗺️ Satellite Map Visualization (D2)

* **Satellite View**: Displays high-resolution map representations of the farm zone.
* **Farm Polygon Rendering**: Uses a styled overlay representing the exact geographic boundary of the farm, color-coded based on severity level.

## ⚙️ Service Scaffolding & Integration (D3)

* **Service Layer**: Configured in `src/services/` with an API client (`src/services/api.js`) and a wrapper logic (`src/services/index.js`).
* **Environment Switch**: Uses `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` in `src/config/environment.js` to run in local mock mode, with automatic fallback to mock data when API calls fail.
* **Loading & Error Components**: Built unified `LoadingState` and `ErrorState` components in `src/components/` to handle asynchronous states gracefully across all screens.

## 📊 SVG Charts & Notifications (D4)

* **Pure SVG Charts**: Built clean, responsive sparklines using React Native SVG (`SvgSparkline` in `FarmDetailScreen.js`) to display NDVI trends and Mandi price trends. This has zero dependencies on heavy native modules, ensuring perfect compatibility with Expo Go.
* **Local Notifications**: Implemented Expo Go compatible local notification scheduling in `src/services/notifications.js`.
* **Push Toggle Settings**: Integrated notification settings switch in Settings screen allowing users to toggle notification handling and trigger permission request flows.
* **Expo SDK 56**: Validated configuration parameters in `package.json` and `app.json` for Expo SDK 56.
